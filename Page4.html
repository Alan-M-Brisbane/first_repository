      <h5 id= "Hon1"><u>Honorable Mention 1:<br>Cryptic Studios - Star Trek Online</u></h5>
      <p id="P1">The massively multiplayer online roleplaying game that is Star Trek Online gets an honorable mention, the game world is based after the existing star trek series' (TOS) The original series with Captain Kirk, (TNG) The Next Generation with Captain Picard (DS9) Deep Space 9 with Commqnder/Captain Sisko and (STVOY) Star Trek Voyager with Captain Janeway, the players charcter exists in the 25th century, about 30 yesar after the Star Trek Nemesis movie. The game has changed over the years with an updated introduction tutorial for new players, there is a lot to choose from when creating a character with most of the well known races available to play, though depending on which faction is chosen a large or small number of races are restricted five factions (Federation, Klingon Empire, Romulan Republic, Federation 23rd Century and the newest faction the Dominion) unless you pay to unlock them, example: Klingons can only be played as part of the Klingon empire but can be unlock for the federation faction. Though the players chosen race and gender is permenant they can still customize their characters body shape, skin, hair, etc, as well as their uniform, even the ships can be customized to a certain degree and as the player progresses through the game they will earn more powerful ships. The story revolves around many of the events of the past series' with the game seemingly continuing to follow on where they left off and giving closure through missions to some of the mysteries that were never fully explained throughout the games story. I like this game for the customization and the attention paid to all the content that connect back to the shows i enjoyed watching, the gameplay is enjoyable though not necessarily for everyone, the game revolves mostly around the story missions so there isnt a lot in the way of exploration and although you can do well without paying for any content, a growing number of new design ships have been added for players to purchase using real world money, this is one of the downsides with the other being the games current state, though some issues have been fixed there are one or two bugs here and there that can make the game difficult to play.

      <h5 id= "Hon1"><u>Honorable Mention 2:<br>Ghostbusters: The Video Game</u></h5>
      <p id= "P2">Based on the orignal movies 'Ghostbusters' and 'Ghostbusters 2' the game does a very good job of making players feel like they are in the movies, the original actors all play their parts with the player taking on the role of a new recruit often referred to as 'the rookie', played from a third person view. The story is fun and enjoyable as you visit places from the first movie and new places in search of paranormal activity that leads the Ghostbusters into uncovering a plot to transform and take over the world. The game itself feels like what the third movie could have been like if they had ever made one. Over the course of the game the player gets to upgrde their proton pack, starting off with the standard <p id= "P6">red</p> energy proton beam as well as three new modes in the forms of the Shock Blast (<p id="P3"> blue</p> energy shotgun style upgrade), Slime Blower (Sprays <p id= "P4">green</p> instead of pink slime a lot like in Ghosbusters 2) and the Meson Collider (<p id= "P5">yellow</p> energy rapid fire upgrade), each with secondary fire abilities. The player also uses their EKG meter to track down ghosts and take scans of them and items affected by paranormal activity, adding them to an archive they can review. This game was a lot of fun to ply by myself but even more fun with my friends, the only downside being that the developer shut down the co-op play.

      <h6 id= "Dis1"><u>Dislike:<br>Bungie - Destiny 1 & 2</u></h6>
      Bungie was once one of my favourite developers, but it slowly slipped from my list as time, and Destiny, went on. Destiny started out good but the story just stopped and never really continued, even as the DLC came out it felt more like they were adding side stories and nothing ever really progressed the main story, or explained it. The second last DLC, the taken king, saw a lot of my friends leave the game, the cost for some was too much and those who did buy it felt the conten was not worth the price, incuding myself. By the time the last DLC was released I could count the number of friends still playing on one hand and even then they were not around very often, doing raids was out of the question as the newer content (weapons/armour/etc) was all locked away behind multiplayer missions and solo play was left with little or nothing and that was pretty much how my time inDestiny 1 ended. It took only a few minutes to decide that Destiny 2 was, for me personally, worse than the first, The character transfer was terrible, all that was kept was your appearance and nothing more, the weapons system had been so oddly re-designed that any of my original strategies were useless, instead of carrying a three weapon loadout like rifle/sniper/RPG like in Destiny 1, I found the sniper rifles, shotguns, etc, all crammed into the third slot with RPGs and the like, forcing me to choose between only one of them and a pair of rifles, smg's or pistols, worse still the heavy machine gun, personally my favourite weapon in the game, had been completely removed and seemed to have been replaced by a grenade launcher. The gameplay was good but once again the story fell short, after losing your powers you run around for a small portion of the game before getting one of them back fairly easily and then working your way to getting back the other two by more or less running around leveling up. The game did have an actual story that was reasonable but it did nothing to further the original plot from Destiny 1, which was to fight our way outward and take back all the worlds we had lost, which a lot of people believed meant leaving the solar system, even the first DLC felt boring and although the second DLC was better the game still didnt feel right, later the mechanics for weapons did recieve a major overhaul and the third DLC was released after that but despite hearing that it seemed this DLC had finally set the game back on course to being the game it should have been I had already lost interest, the weapons system now meant that almost all the weapons previously found the first and second slots now used primary ammo, making it impossible to carry some as secondaries because of the limited ammo, effectiveley limiting my strategies once again. Besides this the new DLC was just as expensive as the Destiny 1: Taken King DLC, based on this past experience I didnt have much confidence or trust in Bungie so have no plans to buy the new DLC, based purely on what i did hear the game seemed to have fallen into a pay to win state with the in-game store supplying some items, cosmetic or otherwise. I do occasionally check the game but have no interest in playing it, even most of my friend avoided it or if they did buy it they don't play as much as they expected they would.
